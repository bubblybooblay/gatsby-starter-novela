The world of computers is a scary place, particularly for the uninitiated.

One day, I decided to venture into this realm, that of the free hosting and that of the 'static site'.
After a lot of whining, head-scratching and I-Don't-Know-What-Else, this website has come to fruition!

The tools I used to build this site:

1. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com "Netlify") (Hosting)
2. [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org "Netlify CMS") (Content Management System - what I use to publish the posts)
3. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org "Gatsby") (Static Site Generator - React based, GraphQL powered)
4. [GitHub](https://www.github.com "GitHub") (Version Control, Backend)

What is still missing is a domain name provider. I am still working on it and it will eventually come through.

The best thing about building a site this way is customization. It is also the worst thing (*internal screaming*) because you will be limited by your technical knowledge.

Thanks to all the tutorials and J, my beloved boyfriend for helping me out on this project. More will come. I might even publish a guide for the other complete beginners out there so stay tuned!
