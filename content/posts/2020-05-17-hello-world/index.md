The world of computers is a scary place, particularly for the uninitiated.

One day, I decided to venture into this realm, that of the free hosting and that of the 'static site'. After a lot of whining, head-scratching and I-Don't-Know-What-Else, this website has come to fruition!

To self-host (i.e. the site is owned by you, not wordpress.com or Google) a website, the typical steps go like this: 

1. Choose a **Content Management System** ("CMS") - the most popular one being Wordpress.com
2. Select a **Hosting Service Provider** - you will pay monthly fees for this service
3. Purchase a **Domain Name** from a Domain Registrar (sometimes you can buy it off the host)
4. Decide on a **Website Theme** (maybe pay for one too) 

and ta-daa, you get a website! Fast and easy! 

**Operating Cost**: USD 100 / year, estimated 

However, if you want to do it my way (the low-cost way), the entry barrier is _slightly_ higher. 

The tools I used to build this site:

You can read the step-by-step guide here: [How to Set Up Novela Starter Theme](beanmusing.com/How-to-Host-Your-Website-for-FREE)):

1. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com "Netlify") (Hosting)
2. [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org "Netlify CMS") (Content Management System - what I use to publish the posts)
3. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org "Gatsby") (Static Site Generator - React based, GraphQL powered)
4. [GitHub](https://www.github.com "GitHub") (Version Control, Backend)
5. [Namesilo](https://www.namesilo.com/register.php?rid=f991a20mf "Namesilo - Affiliate Link") (Domain Registrar)
6. [Inkscape](inkscape.org) (Logo Design - I drew the image by hand and used Inkscape to generate SVG)

**Operating Cost**: USD 8 (I only paid for the domain name!)

**Time Cost**: Well... It took me 2 days (maybe 20 hours?) to get it up and running, which isn't too bad considering it was my first time doing everything. 

The best thing about building a site this way is customization. You have a lot of control over the site, as well as your content. It is also the worst thing (*internal screaming*) because what you can do will be limited by your technical knowledge.

Thank god for Documentation, and thank god my boyfriend is a software developer.
