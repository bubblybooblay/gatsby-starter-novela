Hello World! 

This is my first web project. I have always wanted to have a site with my own domain name, but the hosting cost has prevented me from doing so since it will most likely, always be a hobby. 

It was amazing when I found out Netlify can host a website for free, though it does come with a lot of bells and whistles. It is highly customizable, but it also means you have to know how to customize them. For a complete beginner like me, the process of getting this set up is daunting enough, I was near the edge of breaking down (lol). 

I will post a guide on how to get a Netlify site started for complete beginner with no development background, but for now, Hello World!
