The world of computers is a scary place, particularly for the uninitiated.

One day, I decided to venture into this realm, that of the free hosting and that of the 'static site'. 

After a lot of whining, head-scratching and I-Don't-Know-What-Else, this website has come to fruition! 

The tools I used to build this site: 

1. Netlify (Hosting)

2. Netlify CMS (Content Management System) 

3. Gatsby (Static Site Generator - React based, GraphQL powered)

4. GitHub (Version Control) 

What is still missing is a domain name provider. I am still working on it and it will eventually come through. 

The best thing about building a site this way is customization. It is also the worst thing (**internal screaming**) because you will be limited by your technical knowledge. 

Thanks to all the tutorials and J, my beloved boyfriend for helping me out on this project. More will come. I might even publish a guide for the other complete beginners out there so stay tuned!
