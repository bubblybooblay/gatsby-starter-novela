Hi, I am the writer behind Bean Musing. 

I love reading. I aim to read 52 books a year. You can follow my reading progress on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/cinyyy).

**2019:** [I read 14,990 pages across 52 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/1787581)

**2018:** [I read 10,995 pages across 36 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/1787581)

**2017:** [I read 9,470 pages across 29 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/1787581)


I love traveling. I have stepped foot on 46 countries to-date. I tend to travel cheap too. 

I love food. I'd share my cooking with you.

I love fitness. You can catch me in the gym or at the yoga studio.

And well, at the centre of it all, it is about personal finance. You can find me musing about all of the above, and tie them with money.
