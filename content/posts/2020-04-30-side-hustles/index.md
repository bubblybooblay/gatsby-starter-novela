One of the key components to achieving Financial Independence is having multiple streams of income. In this post, I will detail some side hustles I have done in the past and how much I have made from them. Currently, I am not running any side hustles but will be looking to do so soon!

I will list my side hustles in descending order of the amount earned. 

## 1. Translator Services (c.RM 10,000)

**Source:** Personal contact (if youâ€™re interested to work for the said agency, please check out [Money Moniesâ€™ Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/111054590434146/posts/155665885973016/?d=n). They do pay and I can vouch for the credibility of the business)

**Scope:** I translate Chinese novels into English. Before you sign on to become a translator, you will be taking a test. If you pass, there is a minimum monthly quota (by chapter, and generates about RM 1,100 per month). If you are diligent, you can take on more chapters and your pay can go higher. I personally know some translators who make RM 5,000 to RM 6,000 a month.

**Why I stopped:** The rate is per chapter (RM 55-RM 65) instead of by the number of words (can range between 500-5000 words per chapter). Due to the huge variance, I figure it is no longer worth my time, so I quit. 

## 2. Selling Pre-loved Items (c.RM 1,000)

**Source:** [Carousell](https://my.carousell.com/), [Refash](https://refash.my/) 

**Scope:** I have sold air conditioner (ridiculous, I know), tablet, wardrobes, hamster cage, shoes and etc. Iâ€™ve also sold clothes on Refash platform before they changed the reward scheme (I got a 50% cut for what were sold, instead of a quote for all the accepted items). 

**Why I stopped:** There are only so much pre-loved I can sell. Also, one thing to note is certain products (electronics, IKEA furniture) are way more popular on Carousell than others. 

## 3. Physical Tutoring (c.RM 500)

**Source:** Personal contact

**Scope:** I have done two types of tutoring: one for friends and another for an art center. I used to get tutoring requests from my juniors in secondary school. For the art center, well, my teacher then needed help and he was willing to pay me RM 13 an hour; not bad for a 16-year-old kid and c.10 years ago. ðŸ˜€

**Why I stopped:** I got busy and was about to leave for university. It was not on the top of my list. 

## 4. Part-Time Events Gigs (c.RM 500)

**Source:** Personal contact

**Scope:** Depending on the events, Iâ€™ve worked as a tour guide, cashier, stand guarder, etc. Event jobs like this usually pay about RM 100-RM 150 per day. 

**Why I stopped:** My time is worth a lot more today. 

## 5. Taking Surveys (c.RM 100) 

**Source:** [Rakuten Insight Surveys](https://my.m.aipsurveys.com/s/login); [Vase (Referral Link)](https://getvase.com/?referral=f69c9f), OpinionPanel (no longer available)

**Scope:** Just answer questions. 

**Why I stopped:** You donâ€™t get surveys every day ðŸ˜¦ 

## 6. Earning a Commission (c.RM 100) 

**Source:** Personal contact

**Scope:** Sometimes friends need help to sell their stuff online. My job is to simply communicate and negotiate with interested buyers. If it is successful, I take a cut from the price. 

**Why I stopped:** Deals like this donâ€™t come by all the time.

### Other Side Hustle Ideas
Here are some of the potential side hustles I am looking into: 

#### Writing a Blog
Affiliate marketing and ads revenue can be pretty lucrative if you are good at what you do. 

#### IT Services
A couple of years back I brought my laptop for cleaning because it has slowed considerably (Do you guys know you need to clean your laptop?). While I wanted to do it myself, the complicated disassembling and reassembling process from Youtube was a deterrent. I found a guy to do the job on Lowyat Forum and I brought my laptop to his house. It costed me RM 80, and he works at the comfort of his home! It was really inspiring to me and from the strings of reviews on Lowyat Forum, he must have made decent money from this side gig. There is definitely risk involved, i.e. what if the computer stopped working after the cleaning, but it is definitely something worth venturing into.
