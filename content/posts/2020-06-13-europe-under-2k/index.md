In 2016, I invited my sister over to join me on a Europe tour. I was residing in London at the time.

In 3 weeks time, we covered 5 countries (UK, Italy, Vatican City, Poland and Croatia) and about 10 cities. The best part? We did it for under RM7,600 per person (Cost includes flying from Malaysia). 

We didn't exactly starve. We stayed at Airbnbs instead of hostels. I think what we did right in keeping it at a decent cost were planning ahead and choosing to alternate between cheap and expensive countries.

For example, Poland is considered a "cheap" country, with its currency złoty almost on par with Malaysia (1:1). UK, Italy and Croatia are considered the more expensive countries, but as I was almost local in London, I knew how to get around cheaply. 

As this is not a travel blog, read on to check out my itinerary and budget!

**Please note that this is what you can get from a restaurant or a bakery. It is not your "buy a loaf of bread" or "cook yourself" budget. You can get cheaper food by going about that way.* 

This is definitely not the cheapest Europe trip. You can cut the cost lower by:

1. Wait for a deal for the leg between Malaysia and Europe
2. Not be picky about where you go - literally just use Skyscanner and pick a place  
3. Go for couchsurfing
4. Stay at train stations (Do check if the law is against it and watch out for your own safety!)
5. Stay at hostels (They also usually have amazing locations! To save more money, I usually opted for mixed dorm instead of single-sex oops) 
6. Book your transport as early as possible (Especially the trains)
7. Cook yourself
8. Eat bread / Instant Noodle (well... if you don't live to eat. I love my food so I don't mind spending money on it!)
9. Visit cheaper countries (Non-Euro, non-touristic locations... yet) — That means no Spain, Iceland, France, Scandinavian countries, etc. I have been to the mainstream ones, as well as the non-mainstream ones like the Baltic (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia), and almost always, I prefer the non-mainstream ones. 
10. Avoid the peak seasons, i.e. June-August, and December (Occasionally you get a deal outside of Christmas/ NYE) 

Throwing in some pictures as well! All taken by me :D
